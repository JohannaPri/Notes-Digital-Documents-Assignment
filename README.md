### Why Notes?

Notes is built to be a website that is easy and simple for
everyone to use and to create digital documents. 

Notes is there for you, for whatever you need it to be. It might be to remember your shopping list or to brainstorm or to just write down whats on your mind. 

#### Your Digital Documents Will Always Be With You!

### How does Notes work?

- **This is only a prototype so there for it's only two different users for now.**

    - you can choose to log in as Admin or as Johanna. If you sign in as Admin you can see all created documents between the two users. 
    
    - But if you sign in as Johanna you can only see the documents that are created in that account.

    - When signed in you are free to look around, explore and create documents.

- **You will find everything you need as soon as you are logged in.**

    - On the top of the page you will see a heading that says **My Notes**.

    - Under **My Notes** you will find the log out button. if you press that one you will be logged out and get back to the log in view. 

    - But you will also find all documents you have created or will create under the **My Notes** heading. 
    the documents will line up as a list. 

    - Under the list You will see a heading that says **Create New Note**, under that you have the form. All documents needs to have a Title and Text content for it to be created. 

    - When you have put in a title and some content you will press the button **Add Note**, when pressing the button, your document will be added to the list above the form. 

- **When you see your document in the list (you will se the title that you choosed) you will also see three different buttons on the side of the title.**

    - The first button is called **view** if you press that one you will se your document in reading mode. It will appear in the same place as you created the document. When you are done you press **Close View** and the heading, **Create New Note** will appear again and you will sbe able to create another document. 

    - The next button is **Edit** if you press this button you will end up in editing mode. Here you can change your title or your content or both. When done you press **Save Note** and your changes will be saved and you will now see your new title in the list. 

    - The last button is **Delete** if you press this button, your document will be removed, and you won't see it in the list anymore. 

- **Remember, that it's not possible to create a new document without Title and Contenr. It's the same with Edit you can't press edit and remove title and content and then Save Note. That won't work and your document will not be created/saved**

#### I hope you find Notes as easy and simple to create digital documents as I do!
